      <p> This is an image of a crochet heart I made a few months ago. There are curls of crochet pastel multicolored yarn bursting out of the center, representing one's individuality and passion bursting out of their heart in the emotional sense of the word. </p>

      <p> This is an image of a stone bench near the beach. I took this picture one day as I was taking a walk. I never truly thought photography was one of my strengths, but this image is really relaxing and I do think that it is one of my better pictures. </p>
